For example merging  <code>{:account/id &quot;foo&quot;}</code> with  <code>{:user/id &quot;bar&quot;}&#41;</code> would give you <code>{:account/id &quot;foo&quot; :user/id &quot;bar&quot;}</code>. This lets you avoid unnecessary data nesting and keep your data flat. However, by the time this data gets to the edge of your system, where it meets something that expects json, you will often want to remove these namespaces.

The majority of Clojure's functions are designed to operate on sequences. As a result, Clojure code can be manipulated using the same functions that are used to manipulate Clojure data. In other words, there is no distinction between code and data. Code is data. This property is known as <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity'>homoiconicity</a>. This article will explore this concept.</p></article><article class="post"><h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://andersmurphy.com/2020/02/08/clojure-persistent-rate-limiting.html">Clojure: persistent rate limiting</a></h1><time class="post-date" datetime="2020-02-08T00:00:00+00:00">08 Feb 2020</time><p>Some business needs require you to limit the number of times you do something. An example of this would be sending a daily email to users. You could achieve this by making sure you run the function only once per day. However, if that function were to crash part way through how would you know which users had already been sent their daily email and which hadn't? Resolving this without sending some users multiple emails could be a large time sink. A more robust solution would be to make the email sending function idempotent; meaning the effects of the function are applied only once per user per day and any additional applications do nothing. This article will explore one approach to solving this problem in Clojure.</p></article><article class="post"><h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://andersmurphy.com/2019/12/19/clojure-permutations.html">Clojure: permutations</a></h1><time class="post-date" datetime="2019-12-19T00:00:00+00:00">19 Dec 2019</time><p>I was solving an <a href='https://adventofcode.com/'>Advent of Code</a> problem and part of the solution required generating all the permutations of a set of numbers.

A common use of tuples in Clojure is for representing pairs of data that are related; for example a key and a value when mapping over a map (hashmap/dictionary). That being said, tuples can be of any length and are a common way of representing larger sets of related data in languages that don't use maps as prolifically as Clojure.

So if <code>java.time</code> fixes everything then why this article? Well, <code>java.sql.Timestamp</code> still rears its ugly head at the database layer where it is still the default representation of time in the <code>java.jdbc</code> database drivers.

A pool (cache) of reusable connections is maintained meaning when users connect to the database they can reuse an existing connection. When the user finishes using the connection it is placed back in the pool for other users to use. This reduces the overhead of connecting to the database by decreasing network traffic, limiting the cost of creating new connections, and reducing the load on the garbage collector. Effectively improving the responsiveness of your app for any task that requires connecting to the database.</p></article><article class="post"><h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://andersmurphy.com/2019/07/02/clojure-emoji-in-strings.html">Clojure: emoji in strings</a></h1><time class="post-date" datetime="2019-07-02T00:00:00+00:00">02 Jul 2019</time><p>Sometimes your problem domain requires the use of emoji.
