Permutation is the act of arranging the members of a set into different orders. I wanted to write a recursive solution rather than an imperative solution. After some searching I found a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language'>Scheme</a>) implementation. As Scheme and Clojure are both dialects of Lisp translating one into the other shouldn't be too difficult.</p></article><article class="post"><h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://andersmurphy.com/2019/12/07/ruby-functional-programming.html">Ruby: functional programming</a></h1><time class="post-date" datetime="2019-12-07T00:00:00+00:00">07 Dec 2019</time><p>In one of my previous jobs I worked as a full stack engineer on a codebase with a Ruby backend and a Javascript/React frontend. Having used Clojure a fair bit in my spare time I was keen to code in a functional style. At first glance this seems tricky in Ruby as it doesn't have first class functions.</p></article><article class="post"><h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://andersmurphy.com/2019/11/30/clojure-flattening-key-paths.html">Clojure: flattening key paths</a></h1><time class="post-date" datetime="2019-11-30T00:00:00+00:00">30 Nov 2019</time><p>This article will cover how to flatten the nested key paths of a map in Clojure.

It uses the concept of functional zipper (see <a href='http://gallium.inria.fr/~huet/PUBLIC/zip.pdf'>Functional Pearls The zipper</a>) to make manipulating hierarchical data structures simple and efficient. This article will cover how to use zippers to manipulate HTML/XML in Clojure.</p></article><article class="post"><h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://andersmurphy.com/2019/10/27/clojure-sorting-tuples.html">Clojure: sorting tuples</a></h1><time class="post-date" datetime="2019-10-27T00:00:00+00:00">27 Oct 2019</time><p>A tuple is a finite ordered sequence of elements. A common use of tuples in Clojure is for representing pairs of data that are related. For example a key and a value when mapping over a map (hashmap/dictionary). That being said tuples can be of any length, and are a common way of representing larger sets of related data in languages that don't use maps as prolifically as Clojure. This articles explores sorting tuples in Clojure.</p></article><article class="post"><h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://andersmurphy.com/2019/09/08/clojure-generating-html-and-xml.html">Clojure: generating HTML and XML</a></h1><time class="post-date" datetime="2019-09-08T00:00:00+00:00">08 Sep 2019</time><p>HTML and XML are ubiquitous, whether it's the pages of a static site or configuration for a logger, being able to programmatically generate these files can be really powerful.

So if <code>java.time</code> fixes everything then why this article? Well, <code>java.sql.Timestamp</code> still rears its ugly head at the database layer where it is still the default representation of time in the <code>java.jdbc</code> database drivers. In this article we will cover how to automate the conversion between <code>java.sql.Timestamp</code> and <code>java.time</code> so you never have to deal with <code>java.sql.Timestamp</code> again.</p></article><article class="post"><h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://andersmurphy.com/2019/07/14/clojure-connection-pooling-with-hikari-cp.html">Clojure: connection pooling with hikari-cp</a></h1><time class="post-date" datetime="2019-07-14T00:00:00+00:00">14 Jul 2019</time><p>Connection pooling is a technique for improving app performance. A pool (cache) of reusable connections is maintained meaning when users connect to the database they can reuse an existing connection. When the user finishes using the connection it is placed back in the pool for other users to use. This reduces the overhead of connecting to the database by decreasing network traffic, limiting the cost of creating new connections, and reducing the load on the garbage collector. Effectively improving the responsiveness of your app for any task that requires connecting to the database.</p></article><article class="post"><h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://andersmurphy.com/2019/07/02/clojure-emoji-in-strings.html">Clojure: emoji in strings</a></h1><time class="post-date" datetime="2019-07-02T00:00:00+00:00">02 Jul 2019</time><p>Sometimes your problem domain requires the use of emoji.
