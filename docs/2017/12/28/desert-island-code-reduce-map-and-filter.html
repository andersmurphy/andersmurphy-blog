<p>You awake a castaway on a desert island. After some time you come across an ancient computation device. The programming of which might hold your salvation!</p><p>The device, though limitless in computational power, for better or worse only understands javascript. Alas this dialect of javascript doesn't have map, reduce or filter!</p><p><!&ndash;more&ndash;></p><p>A cruel fate indeed.</p><p>But wait, what if we were to write our own implementations of: map, filter and reduce?</p><h3>Reduce</h3><p>Map and filter can be built with reduce, so lets start with implementing that. Good old for loop to the rescue.</p><pre><code class="javascript">const reduce = &#40;reduceFunc, startingValue, coll&#41; =&gt; {
  let accumulator = startingValue
  for&#40;let i = 0; i &lt; coll.length; i++&#41; {
    accumulator = reduceFunc&#40;accumulator, coll&#91;i&#93;&#41;
  }
  return accumulator
}

reduce&#40;&#40;acc, item&#41; =&gt; acc + item, 0, &#91; 1, 2, 3, 4&#93;&#41; // 10
</code></pre><h3>Map</h3><p>Whenever you want to derive a new value from a collection you can use reduce. Let see how we can use it to implement Map.</p><pre><code class="javascript">const map = &#40;mapFunc, coll&#41; =&gt; reduce&#40;
  &#40;accumulator, item&#41; =&gt; {
    accumulator.push&#40;mapFunc&#40;item&#41;&#41;
    return accumulator
  },
  &#91;&#93;,
  coll
&#41;

map&#40;x =&gt; x + 1, &#91; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5&#93;&#41; // &#91; 2, 3, 4, 5, 6&#93;
</code></pre><h3>Filter</h3><p>Finally, lets implement filter.</p><pre><code class="javascript">const filter = &#40;filterFunc, coll&#41; =&gt; reduce&#40;
  &#40;accumulator, item&#41; =&gt; {
    if&#40;filterFunc&#40;item&#41;&#41; {
      accumulator.push&#40;item&#41;
    }
    return accumulator
  },
  &#91;&#93;,
  coll
&#41;

filter&#40;x =&gt; x === 3, &#91; 3, 2, 3, 4, 3&#93;&#41; // &#91;3, 3, 3&#93;
</code></pre><p>So there you have it. Reduce, map, and filter on a desert island.</p>
