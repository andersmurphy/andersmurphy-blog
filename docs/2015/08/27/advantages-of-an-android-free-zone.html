<p>In Android projects I like to set up an “Android Free Zone”. This is a Java module that doesn’t have any dependencies on the Android libraries. This is where the business logic of the app lives.</p><p>Shielding your business logic from changes to any third party library is always a good thing. But the “Android Free Zone” has other benefits. No need to launch an emulator or use a framework like <a href='http://robolectric.org/'>Robolectric</a> to test your business logic. This helps keep Red-Green-Refactor cycles short, for a more productive TDD workflow.</p><p><!&ndash;more&ndash;></p><p>Test writing becomes easier as there are no dependencies on Android objects. These are often tightly coupled making them laborious to instantiate, leading to unnecessarily complicated tests.</p><p>What about testing the modules that do depend on the Android libraries?  The simple answer? Don’t. Instead keep the code, that depends on Android libraries, simple and without logic (<a href='http://xunitpatterns.com/Humble%20Object.html'>Humble Object Pattern</a>). The android layer of the app effectively becomes a thin adapter layer, that doesn’t need to be brought under test.</p><p>Check out <a href='https://github.com/andersmurphy/chain'>this project</a> for an example of how to set up an "Android Free Zone".</p>
