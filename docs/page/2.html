In this article we explore the <code>bean</code> function and how it makes working with java objects more idiomatic.</p></article><article class="post"><h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://andersmurphy.com/2020/03/01/clojure-code-as-data.html">Clojure: code as data</a></h1><time class="post-date" datetime="2020-03-01T00:00:00+00:00">01 Mar 2020</time><p>In Clojure, the primary representation of code is the S-expression that takes the form of nested sequences (lists and vectors). The majority of Clojure's functions are designed to operate on sequences. As a result, Clojure code can be manipulated using the same functions that are used to manipulate Clojure data. In other words, there is no distinction between code and data. Code is data. This property is known as <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity'>homoiconicity</a>. This article will explore this concept.</p></article><article class="post"><h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://andersmurphy.com/2020/02/08/clojure-persistent-rate-limiting.html">Clojure: persistent rate limiting</a></h1><time class="post-date" datetime="2020-02-08T00:00:00+00:00">08 Feb 2020</time><p>Some business needs require you to limit the number of times you do something. An example of this would be sending a daily email to users. You could achieve this by making sure you run the function only once per day. However, if that function were to crash part way through how would you know which users had already been sent their daily email and which hadn't? Resolving this without sending some users multiple emails could be a large time sink. A more robust solution would be to make the email sending function idempotent; meaning the effects of the function are applied only once per user per day and any additional applications do nothing. This article will explore one approach to solving this problem in Clojure.</p></article><article class="post"><h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://andersmurphy.com/2019/12/19/clojure-permutations.html">Clojure: permutations</a></h1><time class="post-date" datetime="2019-12-19T00:00:00+00:00">19 Dec 2019</time><p>I was solving an <a href='https://adventofcode.com/'>Advent of Code</a> problem and part of the solution required generating all the permutations of a set of numbers. Permutation is the act of arranging the members of a set into different orders. I wanted to write a recursive solution rather than an imperative solution. After some searching I found a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_programming_language'>Scheme</a> implementation. As Scheme and Clojure are both dialects of Lisp, translating one into the other wasn't too difficult.</p></article><article class="post"><h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://andersmurphy.com/2019/12/07/ruby-functional-programming.html">Ruby: functional programming</a></h1><time class="post-date" datetime="2019-12-07T00:00:00+00:00">07 Dec 2019</time><p>In one of my previous jobs I worked as a full stack engineer on a codebase with a Ruby backend and a Javascript/React frontend. Having used Clojure a fair bit in my spare time I was keen to code in a functional style. At first glance this seems tricky in Ruby as it doesn't have first class functions.</p></article><article class="post"><h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://andersmurphy.com/2019/11/30/clojure-flattening-key-paths.html">Clojure: flattening key paths</a></h1><time class="post-date" datetime="2019-11-30T00:00:00+00:00">30 Nov 2019</time><p>This article will cover how to flatten the nested key paths of a map in Clojure; turning a nested map like <code>{:a {:b {:c {:d 1} :e 2}}}</code> into a flat map like <code>{:a-b-c-d 1 :a-b-e 2}</code>.</p></article><article class="post"><h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://andersmurphy.com/2019/11/17/clojure-manipulating-html-and-xml-with-zippers.html">Clojure: manipulating HTML and XML with zippers</a></h1><time class="post-date" datetime="2019-11-17T00:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019</time><p>Clojure provides a powerful namespace for manipulating HTML/XML called <code>clojure.zip</code>. It uses the concept of functional zipper (see <a href='http://gallium.inria.fr/~huet/PUBLIC/zip.pdf'>Functional Pearls The zipper</a>) to make manipulating hierarchical data structures simple and efficient. This article will cover how to use zippers to manipulate HTML/XML in Clojure.</p></article><article class="post"><h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://andersmurphy.com/2019/10/27/clojure-sorting-tuples.html">Clojure: sorting tuples</a></h1><time class="post-date" datetime="2019-10-27T00:00:00+00:00">27 Oct 2019</time><p>A tuple is a finite ordered sequence of elements. A common use of tuples in Clojure is for representing pairs of data that are related; for example a key and a value when mapping over a map (hashmap/dictionary). That being said, tuples can be of any length and are a common way of representing larger sets of related data in languages that don't use maps as prolifically as Clojure. This articles explores sorting tuples in Clojure.</p></article><article class="post"><h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://andersmurphy.com/2019/09/08/clojure-generating-html-and-xml.html">Clojure: generating HTML and XML</a></h1><time class="post-date" datetime="2019-09-08T00:00:00+00:00">08 Sep 2019</time><p>HTML and XML are ubiquitous, whether it's the pages of a static site or configuration for a logger, being able to programmatically generate these files can be really powerful.

So if <code>java.time</code> fixes everything then why this article? Well, <code>java.sql.Timestamp</code> still rears its ugly head at the database layer where it is still the default representation of time in the <code>java.jdbc</code> database drivers. In this article we will cover how to automate the conversion between <code>java.sql.Timestamp</code> and <code>java.time</code> so you never have to deal with <code>java.sql.Timestamp</code> again.</p></article></div><div class="pagination"><div class="pagination-item"><a href="https://andersmurphy.com/index.html"><-</a></div><div class="pagination-item"><a href="https://andersmurphy.com/page/3.html">-></a></div></div></div></body></html>
