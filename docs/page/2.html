This makes it surprisingly enjoyable to extend. It goes something like this: you notice some friction when using a command, you use Emacs' self-documenting features to learn about the command, you investigate the source, you write some elisp, you evaluate it and you try the new and improved command out (all without ever having to restart Emacs).</p></article><article class="post"><h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://andersmurphy.com/2021/11/14/emacs-building-from-source-on-macos.html">Emacs: building from source on macOS</a></h1><time class="post-date" datetime="2021-11-14T00:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2021</time><p>I've always wanted to build Emacs from source as it lets you try new features. Native compilation in particular was something I wanted to explore. Native compilation leverages <code>libgccjit</code> to compile Emacs lisp code to native code making Emacs very snappy.</p></article><article class="post"><h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://andersmurphy.com/2021/11/11/clojure-code-highlights-for-this-website.html">Clojure: code highlights for this website</a></h1><time class="post-date" datetime="2021-11-11T00:00:00+00:00">11 Nov 2021</time><p>When I changed the styling of this website I removed code highlights as part of an exercise in minimalism. Anyway, I recently read this awesome article about writing a <a href='https://blog.michielborkent.nl/writing-clojure-highlighter.html'>Clojure highlighter from scratch in 160 lines</a> which inspired me to add some very basic highlights back to this site.

Clojure doesn't come with a function that does this. Before you say "What about <code>frequencies</code>?", <code>frequencies</code> gives you the total number of occurrences in a sequence of items, not the occurrence count.</p></article><article class="post"><h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://andersmurphy.com/2021/10/24/clojure-ensuring-multimethods-are-required.html">Clojure: ensuring multimethods are required</a></h1><time class="post-date" datetime="2021-10-24T00:00:00+00:00">24 Oct 2021</time><p>Multimethods are fantastic. They give you polymorphism without objects or classes (the best part of Object Oriented without the baggage), multiple dispatch, dynamic dispatch and strong decoupling that allows you to extend code without modifying it (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle'>open closed principle</a>), this even extends to third party code. This decoupling is so good that it's not unheard of to deploy your system without all the <code>defmethod</code> extensions being required! This post will teach you how to prevent this.</p></article><article class="post"><h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://andersmurphy.com/2021/07/18/clojure-destructive-macros.html">Clojure: destructive macros</a></h1><time class="post-date" datetime="2021-07-18T00:00:00+00:00">18 Jul 2021</time><p>In this post we'll cover writing a macro that supports destructuring and does something with the bindings.
